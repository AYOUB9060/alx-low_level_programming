# 7.C-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory contains source code files in the C programming language, which demonstrate the use of pointers, arrays, and strings. These files are part of the Holberton School curriculum and are intended for educational purposes.

## Files

* 0-memset.c - This program copies a given value into a buffer, up to a certain number of bytes.
* 1-memcpy.c - This program copies a given number of bytes from a source buffer to a destination buffer.
* 2-strchr.c - This program searches a given string for a specific character and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that character, or NULL if the character is not found.
* 3-strspn.c - This program calculates the length of a prefix substring consisting of only certain characters from a given string.
* 4-strpbrk.c - This program searches a given string for any of a set of specific characters and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of one of those characters, or NULL if none of them are found.
* 5-strstr.c - This program searches a given string for a substring and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
* 7-print_chessboard.c - This program prints a given 8x8 chessboard.
* 8-print_diagsums.c - This program calculates and prints the sum of the diagonal elements of a given square matrix of integers.
* 100-set_string.c - This program sets the value of a pointer to a char.
* 101-crackme_password - This is an executable file that prints a password when given the correct input.

## Usage

To compile any of these files, use the following command:
+ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra file_name.c -o output_file_name

Replace file_name.c with the name of the file you want to compile, and output_file_name with the name you want to give to the compiled executable.

To run any of these programs, use the following command:
+ ./output_file_name

Replace output_file_name with the name of the executable file you want to run.
