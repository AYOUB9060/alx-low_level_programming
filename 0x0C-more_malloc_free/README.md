# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

This directory contains C source code files that demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation functions such as malloc, calloc, and realloc, as well as the free function.

## Files

* **0-malloc_checked.c:** contains a function that allocates memory using malloc and checks for allocation failure.
* **1-string_nconcat.c:** contains a function that concatenates two strings up to a given size.
* **2-calloc.c:** contains a function that allocates memory for an array using calloc and checks for allocation failure.
* **3-array_range.c:** contains a function that creates an array of integers.
* **100-realloc.c:** contains a function that reallocates memory using realloc and checks for allocation failure.
* **101-mul.c:** contains a function that multiplies two positive numbers.
* **main.h:** a header file containing function prototypes and necessary library imports.
* **_putchar.c:** contains a function to write a character to the standard output.
