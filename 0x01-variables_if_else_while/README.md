# C - Variables, if, else, while
This directory contains exercises and examples related to variables, conditional statements (if/else), and loops (while) in the C programming language. These are fundamental concepts that every C programmer needs to understand and master in order to write efficient and effective code.
## Files
Here's a brief overview of the files in this directory:
0-positive_or_negative.c: This program generates a random number and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.
1-last_digit.c: This program generates a random number and prints its last digit along with a message.
2-print_alphabet.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.
3-print_alphabets.c: This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using nested while loops.
4-print_most_numbers.c: This program prints the numbers from 0 to 9, except for 2 and 4.
5-more_numbers.c: This program prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times using nested loops.
6-print_line.c: This program prints a straight line of n underscores, where n is passed as an argument.
7-print_diagonal.c: This program prints a diagonal line of n backslashes, where n is passed as an argument.
8-print_square.c: This program prints a square of n size, where n is passed as an argument.
9-fizz_buzz.c: This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz"
Feel free to use these files as a starting point for your own C programming projects or as a reference for understanding how variables, if/else statements, and while loops work in C
