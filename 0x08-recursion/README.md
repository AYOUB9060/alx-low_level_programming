# 8. C - Recursion

This directory contains examples of C programs that make use of recursion to solve various problems. Recursion is a powerful tool in programming that allows a function to call itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

## Programs

Here is a list of the programs included in this directory:

0-puts_recursion.c
This program uses recursion to print a given string on the standard output.

### 1-print_rev_recursion.c
This program uses recursion to print a given string in reverse.

### 2-strlen_recursion.c
This program uses recursion to calculate the length of a given string.

### 3-factorial.c
This program uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given integer.

### 4-pow_recursion.c
This program uses recursion to calculate the value of a given number raised to a power.

### 5-sqrt_recursion.c
This program uses recursion to calculate the square root of a given number.

### 6-is_prime_number.c
This program uses recursion to determine if a given number is prime.

### 100-is_palindrome.c
This program uses recursion to determine if a given string is a palindrome.

### 101-wildcmp.c
This program uses recursion to compare two given strings that may contain the wildcard character *.

## Usage

To compile any of the programs, simply use a C compiler such as gcc, like so:
+ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <program-name>.c -o <program-name>

To run a compiled program, simply run:
+ ./<program-name>

Replace <program-name> with the name of the program you want to compile or run.
