# C - Variables, if, else, while
This directory contains exercises and examples related to variables, conditional statements (if/else), and loops (while) in the C programming language. These are fundamental concepts that every C programmer needs to understand and master in order to write efficient and effective code.
## Files
Here's a brief overview of the files in this directory:

0-positive_or_negative.c: This program generates a random number and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

1-last_digit.c: This program generates a random number and prints its last digit along with a message.

2-print_alphabet.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.

3-print_alphabets.c: This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using nested while loops.

4-print_alphabet.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabets, except for q and e.

5-print_numbers.c: This program prints all the numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

6-print_numberz.c: This file contains C code that prints the numbers 0-9 to the standard output, each on a separate line. The numbers are printed using the putchar function.

7-print_tebahpla.c: This file contains C code that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order to the standard output, each letter on a separate line. The letters are printed using the putchar function.

8-print_base16.c: This file contains C code that prints the hexadecimal digits 0-9 and a-f to the standard output, each on a separate line. The digits are printed using the putchar function.

9-print_comb.c: This file contains C code that prints all possible combinations of three different digits in ascending order to the standard output, separated by commas and spaces. The combinations are printed using the putchar function.

Feel free to use these files as a starting point for your own C programming projects or as a reference for understanding how variables, if/else statements, and while loops work in C
